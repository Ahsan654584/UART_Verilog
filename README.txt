UART Communication System in Verilog📌 Project OverviewThis project implements a fully functional Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) communication system using Verilog HDL. The design is rigorously modeled using Finite State Machines (FSM) to facilitate robust serial data transmission and reception between devices without a shared clock signal.This project was developed as a semester requirement for the Digital System Design course at Sukkur IBA University. It demonstrates the practical application of sequential logic, state machine design, and timing synchronization in digital systems.🚀 Key FeaturesFull-Duplex Capability: Independent Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) modules allow simultaneous sending and receiving.FSM-Based Architecture: Uses deterministic Finite State Machines for control logic, ensuring stability and ease of debugging.Standard Protocol (8-N-1):1 Start Bit (Logic 0)8 Data Bits (LSB First)No Parity Bit1 Stop Bit (Logic 1)Robust Error Detection: Includes a Framing Error flag in the receiver to detect synchronization losses or invalid stop bits.Synchronized Baud Rate: Operates at 9600 bps, derived precisely from a 50 MHz system clock.🛠️ Technical SpecificationsParameterValueDescriptionSystem Clock50 MHzThe main clock frequency of the simulation/FPGA.Baud Rate9600 bpsThe speed of data transfer.Data Width8 bitsSize of a single data packet (Byte).Oversampling1x / 16xConfigurable sampling logic for noise immunity.Target DeviceArtix-7Compatible with Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (xc7a12ticsg325-1L).📂 Repository Structure├── src/

📐 Module Details & Logic1. Baud Rate Generator (baud_rate_gen.v)Calculates the timing for bit transitions.Formula: Divider = System Clock / Baud RateCalculation: 50,000,000 / 9600 ≈ 5208Operation: Generates a single-cycle "tick" pulse every 5208 clock cycles.2. Transmitter (uart_tx.v)Ports:Input: clk, reset, tx_start, tx_data[7:0]Output: tx_serial, tx_busyFSM States:IDLE: Output line held High (1). Waits for tx_start signal.START: Drives line Low (0) to signal start of frame.DATA: Shifts out tx_data[0] through tx_data[7] sequentially.STOP: Drives line High (1) for at least one bit period.3. Receiver (uart_rx.v)Ports:Input: clk, reset, rx_serialOutput: rx_data[7:0], rx_done, framing_errorFSM States:IDLE: Monitors rx_serial for a falling edge (Start bit).START_DETECT: Verifies the start bit stays low (glitch filtering).DATA_RECV: Samples the line at the center of each bit period to shift in data.STOP_CHECK: Checks if the line is High (1). If Low, asserts framing_error.💻 Simulation & VerificationThe project includes a comprehensive testbench (uart_tb.v) validated in Xilinx Vivado 2018.2.Test Cases Covered:Normal Character Transmission:Sends ASCII 'A' (0x41).Verifies that tx_serial matches binary 01000001.Verifies rx_data receives 0x41 correctly.Back-to-Back Transmission:Sends two bytes consecutively to ensure the FSM resets properly.Error Injection:Forces the serial line Low during the Stop bit to trigger the framing_error flag.How to Run:Open Vivado or ModelSim.Create a project and import files from src/.Set uart_tb.v as the Top Module.Run Behavioral Simulation for 10ms.Observe signals: tx_serial, rx_done, and rx_data.🔮 Future ScopeParity Bit: Implementation of Even/Odd parity for enhanced error checking.FIFO Buffers: Adding First-In-First-Out buffers to handle high-speed data streams.Hardware Implementation: Synthesis and deployment on the Basys 3 or Nexys A7 FPGA boards.👥 Authors & AcknowledgmentsAuthors:Muhammad Ahsan Kareem (133-22-0022)Sibgha Mursaleen (133-22-0018)Instructor:Dr.-Engr.
